# OPENTV V1.1.0

## SECURITY & PRIVACY
- **Zero-Trust Sandbox**: Fully isolated rendering process.
- **RAM-Only Session**: Volatile storage for cookies and video cache (cleared on exit).
- **Hardened Lock**: Auto-purge of GPU/Shader cache on startup.
- **Lockdown Mode**: No external navigation or intrusive popups allowed. No server-side tracking.

## PERFORMANCE & UX
- **Context-Aware Ambient Light**: Blur engine now fades to black and pauses when app focus is lost to save resources.
- **Zero-Lag Engine**: Progressive list rendering and logo lazy-loading.

## PERSISTENCE
- **Hybrid Storage**: Favorites and Last Played Channel are securely persisted to local JSON, avoiding the volatile session.

**FREEDOM. PERFORMANCE. PRIVACY.**
