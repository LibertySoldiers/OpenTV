  <p><strong>OpenTV</strong> — Modern IPTV, simplified.</p>

### Because, why not ?
OpenTV is a desktop player for those who wanted. 
Just 1300+ channels, a clean layout, and your content.

### Fast. Minimalist. Ours.
- **One-Click Play**: Load playlists and start watching.
- **Auto-Updates**: We ship improvements directly to your desktop.

---

### Get Started
1. Grab the latest `.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/LibertySoldiers/OpenTV/releases).
2. Install.
3. Watch.

### Tech
- Electron + Vanilla JS/CSS.

### Security & Privacy
Certainly the most hardened IPTV players:
- **Full Sandboxing**: The interface is isolated in a secure bubble, preventing any malicious stream from accessing your system.
- **In-Memory Session**: All cookies, video cache, and session data are stored in RAM. Everything is wiped instantly when you close the app.
- **Lockdown Mode**: Strictly blocks all external navigation and popups. No site can hijack your player.
- **Zero Permissions**: The app is forbidden from accessing your camera, microphone, or location.
- **Privacy by Design**: 
  - **No Analytics**: We don't track you. No Google Analytics, no telemetry.
  - **What we see**: Nothing. The only outgoing connection is to check for updates (`version.json`).
  - **Hardened Playlist**: Your playlist (`index.m3u`) is embedded locally inside the application. No external server knows what you are loading.
  - **What is saved**: Only your Favorites and Last Played Channel are saved locally on your computer.
